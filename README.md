# Electron Path and Energy Calculations

This repository contains a set of Python functions that calculate various properties related to electrons, their energy, mean free paths in materials, and semiconductor properties.

## Features

- Calculation of the parallel momentum (`k_paralell`) of electrons based on their energy and angle of incidence.
- Determination of electron energy based on room temperature (`RT_energy`).
- Plotting energy versus temperature.
- Mean free path calculations based on several methods:
    - Seah & Dench formula for organic materials.
    - Seah formula for inorganic materials.
    - TPP-2M formula by Tanuma, Powell, and Penn.
- Debye screening length calculation for semiconductors.
